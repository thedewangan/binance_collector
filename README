BINANCE COLLECTOR 

    Collects K line data for numerous markets every 1 min
    Processes information to get OHLCV for other periods
    Sends reports regarding percentage of data points available


REPORT GENERATION:

-   Expected number of data points is calculated as (REPORT_SERVICE_INTERVAL/PROCESSING_PERIODS)*NUM_MARKETS
    Processing periods are 5 min, 15 min, 30 min and 60 min

-   API is returning empty list for OHLCV for some markets.
    In this case, expected will be more but actual number of data points will be less


LIMITATIONS:

-   A limit is placed on number of markets
    [ Total markets are 1500+ where as API limit is 1200 per minute (?) ]

-   Database queries are synchronous

-   In absence of initial delay of an hour, first report will have less percentage of data points 
    even though all possible records where made
    [Expected value is calculated for entire interval. 
    However, reporting service might not have started at same segment as collection period]

-   Security issues and exception handling/logging


NOTE:

    Single process chosen rather than creating a new process periodically
    Same object will be used to send all requests keeping check on rate limit
    Used aysncio sleep for periodical calls. Could not find something like a scheduler
